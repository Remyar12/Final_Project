Security forces and Border forces are across the states for election and borders could go vulnerable. We must reduce the elections but not to a single one. We could go central every 5 years. South India 1 year post central, North India 2 years post central, West India 3 years post central and so on. Note that if any state government falls, governor takes control until the next election process. Similarly president's rule at center. But still this looks way complicated than it seems.

2. Which means political party has to continuously perform well to be in power.
3. Political parties will be more focused on governance instead of agenda.
4. Bureaucrat and government babus will have to perform despite enjoying their benefits due to continue political pressure to perform.
5. Fast track in government process.
6. Every department has to effectuate their work and bound to develop their process etc.
6. That's how people of India will be able to get to see fast development, governance etc. and people will able to choose the government accordingly for the long term.

I think a best fix for this could be to have instead of one election, two elections. One national election, and one state election. State elections shall be done for all the state assemblies at once. This could be done maybe one to one and a half years after the national election. National election will be for country level issues, and the state elections will be for local issues.

@lavanyasenthil3267,2024-12-21T08:37:28Z,1,"The proposed One Nation, One Election bill in India aims to synchronize the Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections, meaning that all elections would be held simultaneously once every five years. This move is being touted by the BJP government as a significant reform that would streamline the electoral process, save time and resources, and reduce the disruptions caused by frequent elections.

Proponents of the bill argue that holding simultaneous elections would lead to cost savings, less disruption to governance, and more focused policymaking. They also claim that it would prevent the misuse of government resources for campaigning and reduce the influence of money and muscle power in elections.

However, the opposition parties view the One Nation, One Election proposal as a threat to democratic principles. They argue that simultaneous elections would favor national parties over regional ones, potentially diluting the diversity of political representation in the country. They also express concerns about the potential for overpowering the ruling party at both the central and state levels, leading to a situation akin to a single-party dominance or dictatorship.

Critics also highlight logistical challenges, such as constitutional amendments and the synchronization of terms of various state governments, as well as the potential for increased centralization of power at the expense of states' rights.

The debate surrounding the One Nation, One Election bill highlights the complex interplay between political expediency, governance efficiency, and democratic principles.

For example, you mentioned Tamil Nadu, which rejected BJP when the elections were conducted separately, but I would that for any person, the development he seeks would be immediate, which can happen only at the state level and that can make a state completely reject the national party all together as well. I feel that when this comes into the picture, when a state election happens outside of the LS cycle, and if there is a presence of a national party, they would simply deploy all their top leaders which cannot happen so easily when you have  ONOE. Also, in UP BJP, losing recent elections can be the case of the INDIA alliance where vote split didn't happen that much. In fact, if you take an AP example where it aligns with LS. The regional party suddenly became a king maker and can bring tremendous resources to the state from the federal government by Leverage. Lastly, I feel focusing on the issues that political parties can create due to short-term elections if and when the government collapses in any state shouldn't be considered because that can be the case for 5 years as well. In fact, on the bright side, people would get the taste of their governance for 2 years before giving them a 5 year term.

One nation one election helps to get majority to a party and full term is used in development rather than continously waste of time in elections. 
You know what will the cost you know the accountability cost but apart from that candidates how much they spend on elections they spend 1000 to 5000 to get one vote.

There should be a single election system where citizens can vote for any candidate. If the candidate does not function to the citizens interest the citizens can recall their vote. Every three months the vote count is digitally done and if candidate fails the majority then the next candidate who got majority takes power. Same like bank interest revision. This can push accountability to the entire term. Be if school exams or corporate appraisals or bank interest everything is revisited periodically not static for 5 years.

1. on the duration of the election. For 1 election currently it happens in multiple waves, how many waves will it take to conduct one nation and one election.

Election commisssion must first start proving they can conduct elections in single wave in a state and also in single wave across on the country.

Having proven that first will avoid more than 3 to 4 months of model code of conduct. Conducting one election for 4 months kills the time.


2. Why does PM have to fly for each state multiple times for a state election and waste his time in election duty instead focus his time in parliament. Example he came to Tamil Nadu 3 times during state election.

Neither do I buy the point of a party ensuring political survival over long term policy implementation. In modern India, where the conversation of good politics is increasingly becoming about progress and policy, this will in fact weed out political parties who are playing emotional political or politics over hot button issues. If a party that only has 2 years shows intent with long term policies and infrastructure, over a period of time these parties will emerge victorious and the populace will learn to cast their vote for such parties over parties who are opting only for survival politics. Lastly - this is a rare scenario.

Ultimately, I'd like to put my stock in the people of India. They aren't going to reliably vote for sub standard governments. Especially now.

We are good as we are .only thing is can be done is keep election single day in states which has election on same year ..
Like 2024 there was 4 State elections but all was on different dates but government can fix date for all 4 states on just 1 single day ...
Same for other states if some states has election in 2025 like for eg 6 States government can keep the day for all same states on same day ... And repeat it for every year..
Because atlest 3-4 states has election on same year but different months , so we can make up and fix 1 date for all this states... then it will be like 5 states election on same day on that same year, another 5-6 states election on same day on that same year, and then another 5-6 states election on same day during that year .

The state government is doing pretty bad here hence people voted against the ruling party in national polls. National election results clearly was an indication of the anti incumbency.

And we can also have debates show on tv and social media with contesting candidates . Like before state election, candidates hv debate with their opposite parties where they r ableto point their ideologies and people can make decisions and they can hv winning candidate accountable if they don't fulfill their promises becoz they rrecorded live.

Same goes for national election this way public can hv perspective and get to know their points and promises.

We have seen even bjp do that, chandra babu, KCR, and many other leaders. They wasted thousands of crores with just selfish intent. With this change, now no one goes to early elections and waste public money.
I think your point and my point shall neutralise.

2. Only 1 negative point i accept only to some extent is that a govt that comes in unexpired term may not focus on long term.
But i still think the benefits with ONOE is much more than this. Even today most govts are not focusing on longterm, they are just on freebies, like in telanagana, karnataka, even bjp in maharastra which generally is against unnecesaary freebies.

1. Removal of bogus and duplicate votes from the system. For example, when Telangana and Andhra separated, a lot of people still have voting card both in Andhra and Telanagana.
2. A lot of employees working in cities can't go back to their home towns for voting for state elections or central elections. They usually cast vote for any one. 
3. For a country like India, rupee saved is rupee earned. So saving cost on machinery should be of utmost importance. 
4. As you stated regional parties at some disadvantage, should be incentivsed for the political sacrifice. 
5. Once synchronized, we can bring large scale technologies to improve  and optimize which otherwise would be impossible.

It can also be a better thing to have saperate elections in some aspects.

For instance, if the Central Government's term runs from 2025 to 2030, all State Governments across the country should have synchronized terms from mid-2027 to mid-2032. This way, while the central government operates on its own term cycle, the state governments run on a separate yet unified timeline. This approach ensures that the central government doesn't overshadow state governments, while all states operate in the same term cycle. This synchronization allows for better governance, accountability, and a balanced check on power.

It will bring more stability, according to me we should implement it with a few minor changes like adding the president's rule instead of re-election, this will save the distribution of ""freebies"" that literally drains and bleeds our funds, and at the same time it would also provide a stable govt that doesn't care about surviving the re-election. We can save so much money from this and literally make new IITs, IIMs, AIIMS, invest it in our research and development sector which is so poorly funded. The government can also use this money to transform the population to skilled population which will help so many people to not only come out of poverty but also help them to reach new heights in both financial and personal life.

2 Account bility of politician will be less
3feasibilty is possible only after the census of majority of the parties.
But in favour of that we have also some points
1 governance will be improved
2 lakhs of crores and logistics will be saved
3. Possibly, social fabric will remain peaceful most of the time.

This will lead to Political parties to express their political views without fear, considering Alliance ethics. Now what is happening is, first past the vote in General elections, Which means persons voted for losing party, don't have representation, and the winning person sent to parliament or State Assembly. And that requires majority ie half of strength, to pass bill to become an act. which means fooling ourselves, that majority of people voted for the bill, if proportional representation, is made, Parties having spreaded vote will get representation, and able to spread their views on each and every bill before becoming an act.",GlWO3SCDa5M,TRUE

Local body elections can take place in between the central and State.

This will reduce the whole election fiasco to 1 year in place of Every year and would solve a lot of worries.

And For a Govt which fails

Say the Govt fails after 10 months or 20 months then the Election that will happen will be for the term remaining. Governor or President Should do the election within 6 months. If there is a serious Law and Order issue Like WB or Manipur Then The Lok Sabha can pass a General Rights Bill or Something of that sort and Set a State of Emergency and Take a Tenure but this should not be more than 6  months at a Time.

It is also necessary to welcome the decision of Modi Ji to Constitute a Committe to study about the feasibility of working out the Principle of 'One Nation and One Election'  and Appoint the Hon'ble Ex-President of India Shri Ramnath Kovind as its Head.  Keeping in view the Statesmanship and being an Ex-President of India Shri Ramnath Kovind is well deserved to hold the Head of the Committee. 

The proposed conducting of the simultaneous State Elections and the General Elections to the Loka Sabha at one go will help to prevent the collosal loss of time and expenditures involved in the Election.

It may also be taken into consideration that conducting the Elections to the State Assemblies and for the Loka Sabha on one date will confuse the Voters at large to identify and to recognize the Polling is for State or Loka Sabha.  In order to avoid such confusions amongst the Voters the Elections to the State Assembly and for the General Elections to the Loka Sabha will have to be conducted at different dates.

The wonderful Idea of the Hon'ble PM Modi Ji in conducting simulatneously the State Assembly Elections and the Loka Sabha Elections is well deserved to be appreciated and it can save time and also money that will have to be spent for the election.",GlWO3SCDa5M,TRUE

He is just a stupid fool.
He will never talk on solving real issues of nation.
So What if Rahul thinks only congres is a good party and it's secular, but what when he n his party only targets Hindu religion. Always neglects justice in cases where Hindus get attacked and killed and raped and looted by Muslims.

Brahmins brought the caste system to divide us and rule us by joining hands with British. So people who came from central Asia can get back to Central Asia if you are not giving peace and harmony for native Hindus of India.,uX7xsHsmSSo,TRUE

The immaturity of opposition leaders wasting our precious time , money and  important developments.  
Rahul doesn't know anything about Dharm and how it's different from the religion.  Hindu is our cultural identity recognised for various cults,   practices and civilisations.  Rahul's comments are not accepted. It seems he has personal rivalries and attacks on  our integrity as well as identity.  PM Modi ji is just a medium for him to comment and hide his bad intentions.  
Rahul and his entire team of communists are on a mission to destroy the working sessions and  implement the ideas proposed by the Western interests  to defame the glory of the nation. 
Rahul is so ill capable of being a parliamentarian who doesn't fit to participate in a healthy debate and contribution of right suggestions for amendments on various important bills to clear. 
Such a waste of himself who doesn't act seriously  and understands the purpus  of loksabha.

The truth is they didn't have the intention to solve the kashmir issue, and hence the total exodus of kashmiri pundits from jammu and kashmir. the truth is his party didn't have the intention to build defence industry but import through kickbacks, thus led to defence scams like bofors scam, The truth is his party didn't want to solve srilanka tamil issue, and hence resulted in the killings, deaths, atrocities on thousands of srilankan tamils. the truth is his party didn't have the intention to honor sikhs, hence resulted in the deaths of innumerable sikhs, which the contemporary history is evident. They create Prabhakaran, Bhindranwale or anyone and when their necessity is not felt, let them die the most inhumane deaths.
