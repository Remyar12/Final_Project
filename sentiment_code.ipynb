Nahusha was brought in place of Indra, but he got so arrogant that he was turned into a snake. Modi has only used Hinduism as a tool to get votes for himself. When Ayodha's people were displaced just because he wanted the temple inauguration before the elections, he didn't care that he was throwing thousands of poor and helpless Hindus on to the streets. The moment his party lost Ayodha, the BJP IT cell started maligning Ayodhawasis. This is their Hinduism. Modi replaced Jai Shriram with Jai Jagnannath because his part had won in Orissa and lost in Ayodha. This is his Hinduism. His ego has become so inflated that he thinks he is non-biological. And this man claims he speaks on behalf of the Hindus. Hypocrisy, shamelessness, untruth - these cannot be Hindu values.\n",

Rahul was talking about how every religion is great not just hindu, and I agree as a hindu. But look how cleverly and cunningly modi has twisted his words and posed as if he is talking bad about hinduism but he never said that. Is this not drama. At least they talk about something. Modi media is toh entirely playing on religion nowadays. Modi is openly talking just about hindu muslim in his rallies but if rahul gandhi talks about the greatness of ALL the religions, he is doing religion  politics.\n",

Rahul gandhi has forgotten all principles of respecting various religions to be multi religious country and incredible india. Rahul gandhi wants indian military officers to die and expecting peace from the enemy country after hitting 10 bullets on the stomach, can this still  work out in this era. Rahul Gandhi has to apologize modi for the harsh words regarding the speaking with evil , as they are the  lords of the country lord Shiva lord mahadev and lord brahma are the creatures of the universe .if really rahul Gandhi have much power should have to destroy the world considering himself has lord Shiva.\n",
